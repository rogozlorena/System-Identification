# System-Identification project
In this project, I performed the identification of a second-order system without zeros through both parametric and non-parametric methods. For non-parametric identification, I utilized the resonance phenomenon and the Nyquist diagram, while for parametric identification, I employed the ARX, ARMAX, OE, and IV methods.
